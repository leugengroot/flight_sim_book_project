# Jane's Combat Simulations: USNF'97 - U.S. Navy Fighters
## Review
### Milking the Cow?

After the success of US Navy Fighters and its expansion - Marine Fighters, the naval themed flight simulator from EA received another entry in late 1996. The executable was rewritten to support DirectX libraries and run natively on Windows 95. But that was not all. Since EA struck a deal with Jane's Information Group and has already started to release its games with Jane's in the title, USNF benefited from this as well.

### So what's new?

Apart from new executable and tons of bug fixes, the game combined base game - U.S. Navy Fighters with its expansion and as a bonus threw in a new campaign based in South East Asia with new flyable Viernam era aircraft - F-4B and F-4J Phantom II, F-8E Crusader and for the other side MIG-17F "Fresco" and MIG-21F "Fishbed-C". In the campaign you could fly only on the US side but there were several single missions where you would take a role as a Vietnamese pilot flying the Soviet jets. Interestingly when flying as Vietnamese all the spoken dialogue from your wingmen, tower or GCI is in Vietnamese! That was a great attention to detail.

The new campaign consists of 25 missions, some of them presenting a real challenge even for seasoned USNF pilots. The campaign starts with an intro cinematic consisting of US President Nixon's speech followed by the footage of US Navy aircraft in action immersing the player in the conflict. The missions range from air sweeps, combat air patrols, escorts, strikes, SEAD you name it. If you manage to survive the combat, you still need to land on the carrier - and with the Vietnam expansion we've got a new boat to land on - USS Kitty Hawk. Tha main challenge during the Vietnam campaign though is possibly the poor effectiveness of early Sidewinders and Sparrows - achieving a kill is either by sheer luck or a total incompetence on the part of your foe. Better hone on your dog fighting skills with guns. Well, that's why the Fighter Weapons School was established in real life, in USNF'97 you can easily practice with the help of the Quick and Pro Mission creators known from previous releases. Setting up a quick skirmish is just a few clicks away.

The remaining twp campaigns - Ukraine and Kuril remain mostly unchanged. Though they benefit from improved 3d models of a few aircraft (like E-2C Hawkeye). The gameplay was also refined by the inclusion of GCI/AWACS query - at last you could send a "Bogey Dope" request meaning you would get a verbal reply to the nearest bandit. In the Vietnam campaign where Vietnamese aircraft liked to sneak in behind your flight, this call could be a life saver (or you could just scan your 6 o'clock more often). You can use this in every mission, even in Ukraine and Kuril campaigns as long as the AWACS aircraft is present in that mission. There was also more balancing made to the loadouts and weapons statistics - for instance better blast damage modelling from the bombs making some of those old missions a bit easier to beat.

The greatly enhanced part of this sim was the all new Jane's Reference Guide section, which consisted of information on all the units and objects featured in the game. Many descriptions were taken directly from Jane's Information Group database, all flyable aircraft received showcase video clips presenting their design and history totalling in 35 minutes of high-res, interlaced video. Great treat for aviation enthusiasts indeed!

### Final thoughts
Overall the USNF'97 was a solid entry into the EA Fighters series, even if you owned USNF with its Marine Fighters expansion, the inclusion of the Vietnam campaign and all the new features was something to consider. If you didn't own the DOS release it was a no brainer, it was well worth the price. The only downside were a bit higher system requirements, mostly due to the transition to Windows platform, but also because of graphical improvements.

## Trivia
There is no new mystical creature to fight with, like Atomic Moth that could be found in the Kuril Islands, but when you press CTRL-V you will hear "Ride of the Valkyries" blasting from your speakers.
